# Examples

- [function_examples.ipynb](function_examples.ipynb) -- A Jupyter notebook with examples for every veroviz function. 
    - These examples match those provided in each function's "docstring".  Within a Jupyter notebook, you may use the `?` magic command to view a function's complete documentation.  For example:
        ```
        import veroviz as vrv
        # See the documentation for the `generateNodes()` function:
        vrv.generateNodes?
        ```
    - You may download this notebook from [https://veroviz.org/downloads/function_examples.ipynb.zip](https://veroviz.org/downloads/function_examples.ipynb.zip)    

- See https://veroviz.org/downloads/ for a list of available downloads and examples, including:
	- `homepage_demo.ipynb` -- This notebook was created to support the basic example that is showcased on the VeRoViz homepage. The goal is to demonstrate a common workflow (create nodes, calculate distances, solve problem, visualize solutions) via a simple example.
	- `cesium_demo.ipynb` -- This notebook provides code for generating the Cesium demo that is included in the VeRoViz Cesium Viewer plugin.
